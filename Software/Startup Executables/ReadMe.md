### Initial Software to get the project going

* Plug in your camera first
* Since .exe - runs on Windows
* Create an ODBC entry in your system called "vidsendMDB", 
* then start "vidsend.exe" - create server/create client



* In theory you can run as many clients to server as you want; only limitation is your computer hardware and bandwidth
* Atm all in italian language, but we are working on it.
